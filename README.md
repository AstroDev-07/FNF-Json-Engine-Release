# Installation

First your gonna need the requisites:

There should be a folder in ```setup``` that will allow you to install what's needed:

if on windows your gonna need to run both ```setup-windows.bat``` and ```setup-msvc-win.bat```

Linux people your gonna use ```setup-unix.sh```

mac people, idk what your gonna do, i may make a build for you guys in the future

either click the green code button then select "Download Zip"

or

Install git and type

```git clone https://github.com/AstroDev-07/FNF-Json-Engine-Release.git```

# Building

Similar to psych, just run either ```build_x32.bat``` for 32-bit systems and ```build_x64.bat``` for 64-bit, for some reason running ```build_x64-debug.bat``` does not seem to work
