# FNF-Json-Engine-Release
release ver of json engine

# Welcome to FNF Json Engine!

This engine is built of Psych Engine (By ShadowMario)

It aims to allow complete customisation via JSON files

Due to how flixel compiles images and music, to use custom images and music you need to compile the engine with them as i currently have not reverse engineered psych's lua functions. once i manage to complete this i will add it

Read documentation (when done) for help
